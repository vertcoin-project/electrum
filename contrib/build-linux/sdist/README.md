Source tarballs
===============

âœ“ _This file should be reproducible, meaning you should be able to generate
   distributables that match the official releases._

This assumes an Ubuntu (x86_64) host, but it should not be too hard to adapt to another
similar system.

1. Install Docker

    See `contrib/docker_notes.md`.

2. Build source tarball

    ```
    $ ./build.sh
    ```
    If you want reproducibility, try instead e.g.:
    ```
    $ ELECBUILD_COMMIT=HEAD ELECBUILD_NOCACHE=1 ./build.sh
    ```

3. The generated distributables are in `./dist`.
